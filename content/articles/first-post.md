I finally managed to get the basic features of a blog site working with [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org).
This post is written in Markdown and statically generated before being served to 
your eyes. No backend, just static files. I think that's pretty neat.

Life has been pretty busy, but I want to start blogging regularly, 
so I'm happy to finally start publishing on my own.

Creating new posts will mean writing new Markdown files, re-generating the site, 
and publishing the new static files.

At time of writing, this site contains a small amount of non-post content on the side.
Posts are arranged in a list on the home page, with the post route slugs leading 
to the entire post. I still need to find a good solution for searching / browsing 
posts. Something like next/previous post links and pages. I am also interested in 
creating an email newsletter and RSS feed.

I can implement things one step at a time. Each step along the way will still have
a functional site.

Technology used to create this site as of April 8, 2021:
- SSG framework - [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org)
- CSS framework - [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- IDE - [JetBrains WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)
- Hosted as a GitHub page

Hopefully this time I will be able to post more often!
