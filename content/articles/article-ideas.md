description: A list of some potential blogging topics.
---
New site, new ideas. I hope to start blogging at least weekly, if not bi-weekly, about
web development and computer science. I can also throw in some personal projects.

Brainstorming topics:
- What features should a personal blog have? Why not just use WordPress? (ðŸ¤®)
- Bitcoin is bad for the environment (this could be a spicy one)
- Archiving Yahoo Answers (before it's taken down)
- Will AI replace software developers?
- Staying productive as a coder with ADHD and mood disorders
- CI/CD with Azure DevOps
- Deconstruction of NomadBay, a website I made as a companion to the game Last Oasis

Of course, I will also try to write up solutions I find using Javascript, Node, C#, Vue, SQL Server, and .NET during my day job.

Until the next one!
