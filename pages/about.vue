    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Nick Romano, and I operate out of a quiet home near Knoxville, TN. Software development has always been
      an obsession of mine, up to and including when I graduated from Maryville College with a Bachelor's in Computer
      Science.
    </p>
    <p>
      I work with the great folks at the University of Tennessee College of Law to provide our own web portal with many
      features that can only be done in a modern web application. The rest of my time belongs to side projects, game
      streaming, and my beautiful animal friends Zora üòΩ and Wilson üê∂.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm always learning new skills. I have several years experience in .NET, Javascript, and various web frameworks,
      including Vue.js. This website is written with Nuxt.js. I have also developed and released Android applications
      using both Java and Kotlin. Currently I'm working a lot with PWAs and Cloud DevOps solutions.
